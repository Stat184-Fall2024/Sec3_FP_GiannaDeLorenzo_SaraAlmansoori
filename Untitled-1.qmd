##### Introduction
Education and skill development are fundamental for societal progress and individual empowerment. Access to quality education and opportunities for skill acquisition shapes not only the future of individuals but also the development trajectories of nations. However, global disparities in access to education persist, driven by socio-economic, geographic, and gender-based inequalities. This study leverages the UNICEF Learning and Skills dataset to examine global trends, regional disparities, and socio-economic influences on education and skill acquisition. By addressing these dimensions, the research aims to provide actionable insights to guide policies and interventions for equitable education.

##### Literature Review
Numerous studies have highlighted the critical role of education in driving economic development and reducing poverty. Research also underscores significant disparities in access to education and skills training, particularly between high-income and low-income regions, as well as between genders. While existing data sheds light on global trends, this study will build upon prior analyses by focusing on the relationships between socio-economic factors and education outcomes.

##### Research Questions
1. What are the global and regional trends in secondary schools enrollment rates over the past 10 years?

2. Is there significant employment inequality in workplaces, and how do they vary across regions?

3. How do socio-economic factors correlate with individuals' access to quality education and development?

4. How does individuals' access to online learning tools differentiate according to the region and class levels, and what impact does this have on learning?

##### Provenance of the Data

We obtained the data from UNICEF which is the United Nations Children's Fund. It is a UN agency that is responsible for providing assistance to children worldwide pertaining humanitarian and developmental factors. 

##### FAIR and/or CARE Principles

The dataset and analysis will adhere to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Data sources and workflows will be documented and made available in open formats to facilitate future research. Additionally, the CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles will guide the ethical use of data, particularly in ensuring respect for community rights and promoting equity in the dissemination of insights.

##### Analysis Attributes

Temporal Trends: Changes in education metrics over time.

Regional Disparities: Variations across geographic regions.

Gender Disparities: Differences in metrics by gender.

Socio-Economic Correlations: Relationships between education metrics and socio-economic factors.

Digital Access: Availability and impact of digital learning tools.
